# Offline Time Tracker

A Decky Loader plugin that tracks your game time while playing offline on your Steam Deck. Perfect for tracking playtime when you're away from WiFi.

## Features

- 🕒 Tracks playtime for individual games while offline
- 🔄 Automatically detects when you're offline and starts/stops tracking
- ⚙️ Simple enable/disable toggle in the Decky menu
- 📊 View your offline playtime statistics per game
- 🔋 Lightweight and optimized for Steam Deck

## Installation

1. Ensure you have [Decky Loader](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) installed on your Steam Deck
2. Open Decky Plugin Store
3. Search for "Offline Time Tracker"
4. Click "Install"
5. Restart your Steam Deck (optional but recommended)

## Usage

1. Open the Quick Access Menu (QAM) by pressing the `...` button
2. Navigate to the Decky menu (plug icon)
3. Find "Offline Time Tracker" in your list of plugins
4. Toggle the switch to enable/disable time tracking
5. Play your games offline - time will be tracked automatically

## How It Works

The plugin monitors your active game and network status. When you're offline and the plugin is enabled:

- Tracks time spent in each game
- Pauses tracking when you switch games or return to the Steam menu
- Resumes tracking when you go back to a game
- Stores all data locally on your Steam Deck

## Data Privacy

All your playtime data is stored locally on your Steam Deck and is not sent to any external servers. Your gaming data stays private and secure.

## Troubleshooting

- If time tracking doesn't start:
  - Ensure the plugin is enabled in the Decky menu
  - Check that you're actually offline (plugin only tracks when offline)
  - Restart the plugin or your Steam Deck
